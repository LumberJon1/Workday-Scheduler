# Workday-Scheduler

## What it is
Workday Scheduler is an app that allows users to see the current day broken into a
series of hourly blocks, color-coded to indicate whether they are in the past, present,
or future.  Users can edit the content of each hourly block to add tasks or reminders, and
update these items with the press of a button.
Tasks will remain in the browser's local storage, so they will persist upon refreshing.
